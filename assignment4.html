  <h1>Assignment 4 - Lab 120</h1>
  <h3>Intro section </h3>
  <p>The webpages created in assignment 1 and 2 do a relatively good job in terms of accessibility and usability. Both pages are accessible for different devices, and can be used accordingly.
  However, there is also room for improvement. The webpage can be improved on certain things, such as but not limited to: text alternatives for non-text content could have been provided;
  the webpage could have been made more adaptable; the webpage could potentially have been made more distinguishable; the webpage could have been made keyboard accessible;
  and the navigability of the web page could have been; pagebreaks could have been used to increase usability of the webpage; and the dynamic table could have worked.
  All in all, the webpage can be enhanced in multiple ways. Nevertheless, the accessibility and the usability of the webpage are still of a sufficient level.</p>
  <h3> Accessibility highlights </h3>
  <p>The 3 WCAG guidelines that are the most relevant to our page are: 1) Guideline 1.3 Adaptable; 2) Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible; and 3) Guideline 2.4 Navigable.
  Making the page more adaptable would make it easier for different type of users to access the page. Adding the features of keyboard accessibility will make the page advanced.
  Enhancing the navigability of the page will make it easier for users to find content content and determine where they are.</p>
  <h3> Improvement plan section </h3>
  <p> In this the improvement plan, improvement will be prioritized as high(H), medium(M), and low(L).
    <ol type= "1">
      <li> H - Replacing the id attribute that is used for more than one img element to class attribute. <strong>Status:</strong> Completed.</li>
      <li> H - Including missing alt attributes for img elements for  text alternatives for any non-text content. <strong>Status:</strong> Completed.</li>
      <li> H - Removing unvalid elements for HTML5, running HTML5 validator to double check. <strong>Status:</strong> Put on hold due to given limited time.</li>
      <li> H - Indentation adjustments on only HTML file. (CSS, and JavaScript file have proper indentation.) <strong>Status:</strong> Completed</li>
      <li> H - Fix on cancelling the default event handling by using AJAX. <strong>Status:</strong> Put on hold due to time limit.</li>
      <li> M - Adjustments on  resizing text. <strong>Status:</strong> TO WILLIEM - CAN WE DO IT? IS IT POSSIBLE IN CSS???</li>
      <li> M - Investigation to be done for using append functions in HTML table rows. It could be checked if it is the problem with HTML version, a missing library or something else. <strong>Status:</strong> Uncompleted due to limited time and resources.</li>
      <li> L - Adding keyboard operators. <strong>Status:</strong> Put on hold due to given limited time.</li>
      <li> L - Hiding buttons on print page and getting proper places for page-breaks. <strong>Status:</strong> Put on hold due to given limited time</li>
      <li> GUIDLE 1.3 - ? <strong>Status:</strong> </li>
      <li> Guideline  2.4 - a lot of things are missing but what are they exactly?? <strong>Status:</strong>  </li>

    <tr>
      <td>Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.</td>
      <td>Guideline 1.1 has not been met by assignment 1. In case the downloading of the images would not have succeeded, there is no text alternative in place.
        Moreover, there is also no text alternative for the form input boxes. An example text alternative could have been put in the input boxes to demonstrate to the user how the input should look like.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Guideline 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.</td>
      <td>Guideline 1.3 has partly been met by assignment 1. The responsive web design works partly, which causes the content to not be utterly adaptable to every user.
          Furthermore, a correct reading sequence has not been determined.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.</td>
      <td>Guideline 1.4 has partly been met by the assignment.
          The visuals are distinguishable from each other, making it easy for the users to separate foreground from background.
          The contrast ratio mentioned in the guideline has also been met by the assignment. This ratio ensures that people with bad vision are also able to use the website.
          The requirement of resize text has not been met. The responsive web design of the website does not completely work, meaning that the resizing of text could cause problems.
          On top of that, the colours cannot be selected by the user. This caused the AAA-level 1.4.8 requirement to not be met.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.</td>
      <td>Guideline 2.1 has not been met by assignment 1. Users cannot navigate through the website with the keyboard.
          Moreover, the user is not advised a method for moving away.
          The JavaScript added in Assignment 2 has made the operability of the web page much better.
          However, the added content did not add keyboard operators.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Guideline 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.</td>
      <td> Guideline 2.4 has partly been met by the assignments. The web pages do have titles that descripe topic or purpose.
        Moreover, the link (in context) always shows the purpose, making it easy for the reader to navigate through the website.
        The JavaScript was of great help, as it fixed the 2.4.5 and 2.4.7 requirements.
        The AAA-level has not been met by the assignments, unfortunately.
        The 2.4.8 requirement, which states that "information about the user's location within a set of Web pages is available",
        has not been met, for instance.</td>

      <td>A1 CSS Print style: Things such as the form and the submit button of the form and links should not be present in the print-version of the page, and pagebreaks could've been better.</td>

      it was tested for different browsers and seen to work fine with both.</td>
