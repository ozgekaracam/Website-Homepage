      <td>Guideline 1.1 has not been met by assignment 1. In case the downloading of the images would not have succeeded, there is no text alternative in place.</td>
      <td>Guideline 1.3 has partly been met by assignment 1. The responsive web design works partly, which causes the content to not be utterly adaptable to every user.</td>
      <td>Guideline 1.4 has partly been met by the assignment. The visuals are distinguishable from each other, making it easy for the users to separate foreground from background.</td>
      <td>Guideline 2.1 has partly been met by assignment 1. With the keyboard users can navigate throughout the website.</td>
      <td>Guideline 2.4 has partly been met by assignment 1 (level A). The web pages do have titles that descripe topic or purpose.</td>

      <td>Moreover, there is also no text alternative for the form input boxes. An example text alternative should have been put in the input boxes.</td>
      <td>Furthermore, a correct reading sequence has not been determined.</td>
      <td>The contrast ratio mentioned in the guideline has also been met by the assignment. This ratio ensures that people with bad vision are also able to use the website.</td>
      <td>The reason why the guideline has only partly been met, is because the user is not advised a method for moving away.</td>
      <td>Moreover, the link (in context) always shows the purpose, making it easy for the reader to navigate through the website.</td>

      <td>In order for the assignment to meet level AA though, some requirements still have to be met. The 2.4.7 focus visible requirement has not been met, for instance.</td>
