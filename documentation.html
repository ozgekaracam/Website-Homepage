<p> Hello, front-end developer!</p>

<p> Here you will find the instructions for using this RESTful web API.</p>

Typically, RESTful web APIs use four of the HTTP request verbs to implement CRUD operations:

<ul>POST - Create a new resource</ul>
<ul>GET - Retrieve a resource</ul>
<ul>PUT - Update a resource</ul>
<ul>DELETE - Delete a resource</ul>

<p>
  <br>
  In this document, we will shortly discuss how you can use any of those four operations.<br><br>

  A POST request is used to create a new resource.<br>
  If not all the information is provided, either this error message<br>
  ("Ops! You are missing some fields!"), or this error message
  ("Please fill in all mandatory fields.") will be displayed.<br>
  In an error case, a 400 status will be displayed.<br>
  When successful, a 201 message will be provided.<br>
  The information will then be uploaded in the table.<br><br>

  The MIME type looks as follows:

  <ul>POST http://localhost:3000/post HTTP/1.1</ul>
  <ul>Host: localhost:3000</ul>
  <ul>Content-Type: application/json</ul>
  <ul>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564</ul>
  <ul>Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL</ul>
</p>

<p>
  <br>
  A GET request is used to retrieve a resource.<br>
  In the “happy” (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in JSON.<br>
  The JSON will represent the product information (brand, model, os, image, screensize) in order.<br>
  In an error case, a 400 status will occur.<br><br>

  The MIME type looks as follows:

  <ul>GET http://localhost:3000/get HTTP/1.1</ul>
  <ul>Host: localhost:3000</ul>
  <ul>Content-Type: application/json</ul>
  <ul>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564</ul>
  <ul>Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL</ul>
</p>

<p>
  <br>
  A PUT request is used by Web APIs to update an existing resource.<br>
  If not all the information is provided, either this error message<br>
  ("Ops! You are missing some fields!"), or this error message
  ("Please fill in all mandatory fields.") will be displayed.<br>
  If all the information has been provided, but the update request does not work, <br>
  a 400 status will be returned.<br>
  If the update has been performed successfully, a 201 status will be returned,<br>
  and the information will be updated.<br><br>

  The MIME type looks as follows:

  <ul>PUT http://localhost:3000/put HTTP/1.1</ul>
  <ul>Host: localhost:3000</ul>
  <ul>Content-Type: application/json</ul>
  <ul>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564</ul>
  <ul>Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL</ul>

</p>

<p>
  <br>
  A DELETE request is used by Web APIs to delete an existing resource.<br>
  If the id is not provided, the following error message will be displayed:<br>
  "Ops! You are missing the id to delete!"<br>
  A 400 status will be returned if an error occurs when deleting the information.<br>
  The following error message 201 ("Item is deleted succesfully.")<br>
  will be displayed when an item has successfully been deleted.<br>

  The MIME type looks as follows:

  <ul>DELETE http://localhost:3000/delete HTTP/1.1</ul>
  <ul>Host: localhost:3000</ul>
  <ul>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564</ul>
</p>
</body>
