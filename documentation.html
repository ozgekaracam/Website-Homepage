Hello,front-end developer!

Here you will find the instructions for using this RESTful web API.

Typically, RESTful web APIs use four of the HTTP request verbs to implement CRUD operations:

POST - Create a new resource
GET - Retrieve a resource
PUT - Update a resource
DELETE - Delete a resource

In this document, we will shortly discuss how you can use any of those four operations.

A POST request is used to create a new resource.
The only input a POST request requires is the endpoint URI ('/post').

Upon successful return, HTTP status 201 will be given,
returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource.

The MIME type looks as follows:

POST api/post HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564
Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL



A GET request is used to retrieve a resource.

In the “happy” (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK).
In an error case, it returns either a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

The MIME type looks as follows:

GET api/get HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564
Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL



A PUT request is used by Web APIs to update an existing resource.
A 400 status will be returned if an error occurs.
A 404 status will occur if the input is not found.
A 204 status will be returned for a successful update.

The only input a put request requires is the endpoint URI ('/put').

The MIME type looks as follows:

PUT api/put HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564
Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL


A DELETE request is used by Web APIs to delete an existing resource.
A 400 status will be returned if an error occurs.
A 404 status will occur if the input is not found.
A 204 status will be returned for a successful delete.

The MIME type looks as follows:

DELETE api/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/48.0.2564
Type: id = INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      brand = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model = CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      os = CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      image = CHAR(254) NOT NULL,
      screensize = INTEGER NOT NULL
